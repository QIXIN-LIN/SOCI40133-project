# Fanfiction Trends Analysis: A Participatory Culture Study (SOCI40133-project-NEW)

## Motivation

In the digital age, the rise of participatory culture signifies a pivotal shift in dynamics from passive consumption to active engagement. This project draws inspiration from fanfiction, a microcosm of collaboration, to understand and analyze community narratives. It reflects broader trends and gauges the cultural impact of fan-created content, offering insights into the empowerment through engagement.

## Research Questions

This study aims to explore:
- What are the prevalent writing trends in fanfiction?
- How do reading preferences in fanfiction evolve over time?

By analyzing the AO3 dataset, which encompasses over 200,000 fanfiction records from 1999 to 2020, including titles, descriptions, and various statistics, we delve into word count trends, ratings, themes, and semantic embeddings to answer these questions.

## Repository Navigation

- `notebook/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for descriptive analysis, theme classification, embedding analysis, and final analysis.
- `data/`: Hosts the dataset. Due to size constraints, a link to the dataset is provided if the data is too large for direct inclusion.

## Summary of Findings

### Trends in Writing Length
Our analysis reveals a notable shift toward brevity in fanfiction writing over the observed period.

### The 2020 Phenomenon
The year 2020 emerges as a turning point, marked by a significant increase in both the volume of readings and the length of writings.

### Mature and Explicit Themes
There's a rising preference for mature and explicit themes, alongside a trend toward darker themes in both writing and reading.

### Stability Amidst Evolution
Despite these evolving trends, a constant core of fanfiction themes and engagement persists, underscoring the community's resilience.

## Future Direction

Looking forward, we aim to explore post-2020 trajectories, particularly the longevity of COVID-19's cultural impact on fanfiction. This includes examining whether fanfiction can act as a reflection of contemporary mindsets and if content preferences mirror collective attitudes.

## Dataset

The study is based on the AO3 dataset, which includes over 200,000 fanfiction records spanning from 1999 to 2020. The dataset features titles, descriptions, and various statistics, providing a rich foundation for analysis.

**Question**

My project examines fan-fiction on the Archive of Our Own (AO3) platform to explore the interplay between individual creativity and collective cultural patterns. It aims to understand how the narratives shared and consumed within this community influence and reflect broader participatory culture dynamics.

**Data**

The research focuses on AO3 fan-fiction texts from 2009 to 2020 and other fan-fiction data including comments, hits, finished or not, etc.

**Methods**
+ Using word embedding to analyze semantic changes.
+ Applying topic modeling to identify prevalent themes.
+ Integrating deep learning for causal inference between linguistic patterns and cultural trends.
